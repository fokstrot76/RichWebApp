	var style = "<h2>Dragon Style Kung Fu</h2><p>Modern Southern Dragon style's history can be reliably traced back to the mon​k Daai Yuk Sim Si who was the abbot of Wa Sa Tou (White Hair) temple on Mount Loufu Southern Dragon style has roots in Hakka Kuen, a combination of the local styles of the Hakka heartland in inland eastern Guangdoa with the style that the monk Ji Si Si Sim taught in Guangdong and the neighboring province of Fujian in the 18th century.</p><p>Southern Dragon kung fu is essentially an internal, qi (pronounced chi) cultivating method, but initial training is far more like a hard, external style, than the delicate approach an internal (like ​Tai Chi Chuan or Baguazhang) would have. In learning the moves, the student will strike hard, block hard and stomp into each position, with the idea of learning the proper place to be once each movement is complete. Eventually, the method of transmitting power is retained, and the physically strengthened body is able to make transitions in the proper, fluid manner. In turn, this dragon-like smoothness helps disguise the attack, making it extremely difficult for an adversary to effectively counter.</p><p>Dragon Style (Dragon form) focuses mainly on powerful, short range attacks, as is common among southern Chinese styles of kung fu. However, the styles' use of gripping and seizing techniques as well as the extensive use of the forearms both offensively and defensively are fairly unique to the art. The style was created as an aggressive combat art and operates under the basic assumption that you are trying to either disable your opponent to the point that they are no longer a threat in battle, or kill them, though these are not by any means the only options a Dragon Style practitioner has. As such Dragon Style employs a large number of techniques to damage the opponent's joints either through joint manipulation or direct striking; nullify the opponent's defenses either through breaking their stance or compromising their guard, and thus their ability to defend; and others. Like most southern style kung fu, it has limited kicks and jumps and consisted mainly of fist, palm and clawing techniques. Power generated from the waist using soft hard jin (see neijin and waijin).​ Dragon Style training also involves an extensive amount of iron body training. Hardening the forearms especially is considered essential to the style as it makes such extensive use of them. Depending on the particular school any of a fairly large pool of traditional training methods will be used to toughen the body. Three, five and seven star conditioning drills, pea buckets, weighted ropes, sand bags, and striking poles are all common in Dragon Style schools. It really isn't possible to separate Lung Ying conditioning from its methods, the two work hand in hand, each needing the other to be completely effective.​</p><p>In Southern Dragon style, leg work is characterized by a zig-zag motion that mimics the imagined movement of the mythical Chinese dragon. This also allows one to use floating and sinking movements which are very important in generating power and stability, making your body calm and relaxed.​ Though the Lung Ying footwork pool is deep, it generally centers around two basic types of stepping. The first is “Zig Zag” stepping (dragon stepping). Basically with each step forward, the rear foot moves forward and becomes the forward foot. However, the step is not taken directly forward but basically follows the angle the front foot is turned at (about 33 degrees). This has the effect of moving the DS player forward and off to an angle while offering some protection to the groin from attack. This type of stepping allows a lung ying player to press his opponent (usually used before the opponent's center has been taken) while launching attacks from angles that are difficult for the opponent to defend. The DS player seems to be constantly moving into an uncomfortable range and at an angle that forces their opponent to reposition their whole body to defend against, or else torque their torso around thus breaking their structure and disconnecting them from the power generation machinery of their lower body.​ The second basic type of stepping is Bik Bo stepping, or press stepping. In this method the front foot moves forward and the rear foot drags up to get back to the basic position. This stepping generally covers less distance than the dragon stepping, and is used to press the opponent. It will frequently be used once the DS player has begun to press their attack in earnest or is exploiting some advantage. There are specific methods for stretching this footwork out addressed in various forms. One of the primary purposes of this footwork is to keep the DS player 'on top of' their opponent and in attacking range. Also, this type of stepping is heavily used in various stance breaking methods.</p>";
	var health = "<h2>Dragonstyle for Health & Fitness </h2><p>Dragonstyle is a great way to keep fit as the movements within the style are explosive (plyometric) and lead to the body burning stored fat. The style also teaches you to use your body and coordination (kinesthetic).  Dragonstyle provides a great workout as all of the body muscle groups, tendons and ligaments are exercised and stretched. </p><p>The classes are run through a mixture of modern and old-school training methods. Boxing drills on pads and punch bags as well as bodyweight exercises compliment the dragonstyle movements (sets) to keep the practitioner in good shape and confident of their  abilities.</p><p>It is a firm belief of the Dragonstyle Sifu that you need to be fit to be able to apply your technique. Regardless of your power if you are not fit you will get out of breath when in combat and loss your focus and the battle.  A good fit and healthy body is a must for the serious practitioner; through commitment to hard training and good diet this can be achieved. </p><b>The benefits are obvious feeling and looking better both physically and mentally. </b>";
	var defence = "<h2>Dragonstyle Kungfu for Self Defence</h2><p>Dragon Kungfu is one of  most effective styles of martial arts for self defence and was designed to equip the practitioner with a suite of techniques that will work in a real life combat situation. Because of the nature of real life fighting  Dragonstyle Kungfu was developed to be practical and efficient. The movements are short and the focus is on trapping, striking and  disabling the opponent quickly and effectively.  Through use of correct footwork (stances) and sinking (curling ) of the body the dragon player conceals vulnerable points on his body to protect him from attacks delivered by the opponent. Dragonstyle relies on good body mechanics to generate “shock power” extreme force when delivering blows, this enables the practitioner to neutralise his opponent quickly. The style prefers to attack from angles to expose the vital points on the opponent unlike some of the Kungfu systems dragonstyle is not a liner system and acknowledges that others may be stronger than you and so to meet force with force is pointless, it is better to use the footwork to take a position of advantage before exploiting the opponents weakness and delivering a fast and subduing blow. </p><p>The moves within dragonstyle are not movie Kungfu and were never designed to look pretty or eye catching they were designed to be effective. If you train correctly at Dragonstyle you will get an understanding of fighting concepts and strategies needed to defend oneself when under attack. The dragonstyle player is not a brut but rather a tactical fighter who can adopt to the situation as required. </p>";
	var qigong = "<h2>What is Qigong?</h2><p>Qigong is an ancient powerful self healing art which through breathing and movement uses the body’s energy to heal aliments.</p><p>The use of qigong goes back to over 5000 years ago when the royalty of china and its warrior class would use the art to strengthen the flow of their energy (life force) resulting in improved health and strength.</p><p>Qi is the Chinese word for energy and Gong is the Chinese word for practice or work so essentially qigong means energy work.</p><p>The movements of qigong coordinated with the breathing are designed to absorb the earth’s energy while driving out any toxic energy from the body resulting in the clearing of the meridians (energy channels).</p><p>After continues prolonged practice the qigong practitioner will develop an awareness of the energy in the body and be able to use their mind to channel the energy to where ever it needs to go to promote healing. The mind moves the Qi and the Qi moves the body.</p><b>The benefits are overall better health:</b><ul><li>Builds the muscles through movement- unlike aerobic type exercise it do not contract muscle and so the energy is allowed to follow</li><li>Strengthens and balances internal organs- there are specific exercises designed to strengthen the body organs.</li><li>Increases blood flow- the chi moves the blood which promotes healing</li><li>Improves breathing capacity- through specific breathing techniques lung function/ capacity is increased which results in better endurance </li><li>Clears blockages in the body- the chi works with the nervous system as an intermediary between the body and mind and so strengthens the nerves . This is really beneficial to people with nerve disorders or motor problems. </li><li>The Qi flow increase elasticity of the blood vessels- so is a great treatment for low or high blood pressure.</li><li>Qigong movement allows the energy to move the blood to joints- promotes healing of ligament and tendons- sitting for too long in work or at home can weaken the body as the circulation of your fluids becomes slow and your tension increases. This is most damaging to the body as it strains our nervous system.</li></ul><b>Through the practice of Qigong we can develop a stable internal body and energy structure to keep us physically comfortable and mentally alert.</b>";
	var iron = "<h2>Ironfist: 铁掌功  </h2><p>Ironfist practices are taught at the school although not compulsory  they are useful to build the strength of the bone, ligament and tendon in the hands so the practitioner will be confident they can strike with force without damaging or breaking their own hand. Most schools of Kungfu will have some form of Ironfist training practiced with variant degrees of intensity. </p><p>Typically training starts with finger strengthening exercises such as finger push-ups and holding of different positions on the fingers. The hitting of a soft gravel bag will be the first step leading onto heavier bags with gravel and small stone using all parts of the hand to strike. At the highest stage the practitioner will be hitting stone and using  lead shot and will be able to demonstrate their level of proficiency by breaking concrete and stone of heavy dimensions with a single strike. </p><h2>Iron body: 鐵衫</h2><p>Iron body is a practice of building up the body's resistance to blows so it can withstand the demands of combat. This practice has to be developed very slowly as the body houses the internal organs and incorrect practice could result in damage to those organs. The practice should marry the breathing and coordination of movement to prepare the practitioner for the blows. Correct use of Qigong is essential to developing good iron body, for the martial art without an internal focus iron body could be counterproductive.</p><p>Paramount to all Ironfist and iron body practices is that the Sifu (master) of the school has a good understanding of the anatomy of the human body and Dit Dar Chinese herbs – Dit Dar Jow or Fall & hit wine is a herbal solution that has been used to heal the damage done by iron practices for many centuries and will stop the practitioner developing aliments such as nerve damage, arthritis in later life. As with all things – if practiced with knowledge it can be most beneficial but without  such knowledge it can lead to problems. </p><b>Sifu Scott is a long time practitioner of iron fist & body,  a TC herbalist who supplies and makes the Fall & hit wine for all of his students </b>";

	var lei = "<h2>Lei Tai and Sparring in Dragonstyle</h2><b>Why we spar </b><p>Yes we spar in Dragonstyle unlike some styles of Kungfu where sparring is not required…We  partake in sparring  to develop ones understanding of how to apply the fighting principles and techniques of the system in a controlled situation. Simply put, how can you be sure you can execute your styles technique without real practice. Man-to-man drills and shadow boxing will not achieve  this, a real life opponent is different - their movement, attack , live power will all impact on whether you can apply your technique or not  – this takes confidence and  ability that can only be realised in real combat- Lei Tai provides such a an opportunity to the practitioner. </p><b>What is Lei Tai </b><p>Lei Tai is fighting on a platform typically 2.5 meters high and measuring 100 meters squared, the match can be won by either beating the opponent on the platform or knocking him from the platform. In days of old - Chinese fighters / Kungfu Masters  would erect  a lei tai platform in an area (village or city) and present challenges to the other Kungfu masters of that  area, only after beating all of the challengers would the issuer be deemed the top Kungfu master of the area. This would also set the masters style of Kungfu as the dominant style throughout the area – which usually resulted in his school of Kungfu becoming the superior and most sought after school of Kungfu.</p><b>Our Dragonstyle Sifu is the Vice-president of the Koushu in Ireland and provides students with access to Lei Tai Fighting competition both nationally and internationally </b>";
